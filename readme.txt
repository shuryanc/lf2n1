This mod adds lf1 characters, attacks and the corresponding effects to lf2.
To save time, its based on sprite and dat of YinYin's lf1/2 project with further editing.
It also uses a character in a mod called lf3.

Don't expect the mod to be same as lf1 as its not my focus. So there should be balancing issue or something different from lf1.
The only thing that I want but am unable to fix is Deep's sword attack

Not do:
-Jump to throw
-Pick to switch item
-Game Balance
-Accurate original LF1 hp/mp usage/recovery, attack damage
-lf1 Rebond lf2 ball height

Unable to do:
-Deep Sword attack
